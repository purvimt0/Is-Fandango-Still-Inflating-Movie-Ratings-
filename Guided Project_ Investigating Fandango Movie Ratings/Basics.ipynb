    "# An Examination of Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution Fandango's movie ratings were left skewed, suggesting that they were high or very high. The displayed ratings were even higher than their actual ratings, as there were a number of rounding errors. These rounding errors rounded the scores higher than they should have, suggesting that Fandango inflates their ratings under the hood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango has since come out and said that these errors were a result of a bug in the system. They promised to fix this bug as soon as possible. This project will analyze the data in order to see if Fandango has,in fact, fixed the bug. "
